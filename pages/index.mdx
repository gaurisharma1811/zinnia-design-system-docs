# Welcome to Bloom

## Introduction

Welcome to the Zinnia Design System, Bloom, the backbone for building the Zinnia digital products. Bloom provides guidance on product foundations, UI foundations, base elements, and layouts. These guidelines distinguish our products to establish a consistent aesthetic across the Zinnia ecosystem. Bloom supports a shared language enabling our creative teams to uphold standards that consistently deliver outstanding user experiences. This is a living document and is under constant iteration.

## Contributions are welcome!

Building up a design system is a lot of work. If we can get help from organization peers, that is a tremendous help. Peer contributions mean we can fix bugs or improve features before the customers notice anything. All in all, contributions are a win for the adoption, development speed, and overall quality of the Bloom design system.
