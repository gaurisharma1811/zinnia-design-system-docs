# Accessibility

We prioritize accessibility in our button design to ensure seamless interaction for all users. Elements like size, contrast, and keyboard navigation are key to creating a universally usable and inclusive interface. This section outlines our standards and best practices for accessible button design, accompanied by detailed diagrams to illustrate its functionality.

  ## Keyboard Navigation

  | Keys | Action |
  |:-----|:-------|
  | Tab | Focus lands on (active) buttons |
  | Space/Enter | Activates (active) buttons |

  ## Labeling Elements 

  - Label the alternative text using the visible text that is within the button.
  - When labeling a button with no visible text, like an icon, the accessibility text should describe the action of the button.

  **ex. "Bookmark"**

  - When labeling text with an icon next to it, do not add a label to the icon. This will confuse screen readers.
